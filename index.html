In order to address a current cocktail of health threats, Americans must alter their diets and do so radically. Those alterations must begin with a dramatic reduction in the consumption of sugars.'

Obesity\'s causes, mechanisms, health consequences, and preventive approaches are all devilishly complicated, but Dr. Lustig\'s outstanding contribution clarifies the complexity via a writing style that\'s accessible, insightful, and often gently humorous. Robert Lustig is a clinician, a scientist, and an advocate — a combination that that makes him uniquely qualified to bring the condition\'s many facets into sharp focus. Obesity has become the world\'s number one health problem. Fat Chance is the book for all of us who must confront this epidemic.'

                    quote: 'Our eating habits are killing us. In this timely and important book, Dr. Robert Lustig presents the scientific evidence for the toxicity of sugar and the disastrous effects of modern industrial food on the hormones that control hunger, satiety, and weight. He gives recommendations for a personal solution to the problem we face and also suggests a public policy solution. Fat Chance is the best book I\'ve read on the relationship between diet and health and the clearest explanation of epidemic obesity in our society.'
